# hobbyStore

Ecommerce site example

Technologies: SQL, PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and phpMyAdmin

The Hobby Store is under construction right now and so any and all layouts and code will be changing and may not currently display or function properly. The overall concept is based off of a hobby store selling games, toys, and puzzles. Clash Games is my actual board game company which is still in the process of creating its first game. Because of this all toys and games currently on the site are simply things that are not Seths but are a collection of real items.
